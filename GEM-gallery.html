			<p class="caption">The Natural History Museum collaborated with GEM as a part of our Rethinking Migration Series. This event was open to the public and our Girasoles were able to shine as storytellers and showcase their work. The Girasoles had the task of reconnecting with their family and elders to learn about their family’s migration story. They became the storytellers of their family’s journey. Through Zines, portraits, collages, and butterflies, their stories were shared with pride.</p>
